# Attributarchy

An attribute-driven hierarchy builder for Rails views.

## The Idea

**You do this:**

1. Configure a hierarchy (or hierarchies, eventually) of attributes
1. Create partials for each attribute
1. Feed this duo some data

**And you get this:**

Dynamic, hierarchical views that allow you to easily dish out an array of layouts, styles, and behavior. All as simple or complex as you'd like.
